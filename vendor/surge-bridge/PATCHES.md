# DAW-AI patches

This is `surge-bridge` from the official `surge-synthesizer/surge-rs` repository
at commit `7bfeafc76d1c57860a177e9e076bed7ec764009a`.

It is licensed GPL-3.0-or-later; see `../surge-sys/LICENSE` for a copy.

DAW-AI constructs headless synthesizers with Surge XT's
`skipPatchLoadDataPathSentinel` and one process-lifetime plugin layer, matching
Surge XT's own headless test runner. The upstream bridge passes an empty data
path and allocates a different leaked plugin layer for every engine.

DAW-AI seeds the headless engine deterministically after construction so the
same project range produces identical PCM across byte-range playback renders.
